<h1 i18n>Hey there!</h1>

  <p i18n>
    My name is Jordan BORDONADO and I'm a fullstack developer for Air France in
    Sophia-Antipolis (France).
  </p>
  <p i18n>
    I have a lot of passion for development and I like clean code, fairly tested
    and easy to read so I try to set high expectations for myself.
